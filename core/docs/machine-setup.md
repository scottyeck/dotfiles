## Manual Installs

These are applications whose installations I don't currently automate because manual installation is simpler.

### True Color w/ Alacritty / Tmux / Nvim

In order to properly use true color, we need to install `tmux-256color` so we can specify it as our `TERM` in `tmux`. This is non-trivial so even though others have written about this (extensively), steps are consolidated below.

#### Install `tmux-256color`

(Via [bbqtd](https://gist.github.com/bbqtd/a4ac060d6f6b9ea6fe3aabe735aa9d95#the-right-way))

First, ensure ncurses `tic` is installed.

```
$ which tic
/usr/bin/tic
```

Download and unpack the latest nucurses terminal descriptions:

```
$ curl -LO https://invisible-island.net/datafiles/current/terminfo.src.gz && gunzip terminfo.src.gz
```

And compile `tmux-256color` terminal info. (This will place its result into `~/.terminfo`):

```
$ /usr/bin/tic -xe tmux-256color terminfo.src
```

Then verify

```
$ infocmp tmux-256color
```

Settings in `.zshrc` / `tmux.conf` will now work as intended.

### Enable RGB colors

(Via [Niing](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/678901), self-proclaimed _"Neovim master"_ but hey this is helpful so maybe the proclamation is valid.)

Assuming _alacritty_ was installed using Homebrew, clone [`alacritty/alacritty`](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) and place it anywhere. Then...

```
$ cd path/to/cloned-alacritty-repo
$ sudo tic -xe alacritty,alacritty-direct extra/alacritty.info
```

Again, `TERM` settings in `.zshrc` will now work as intended.
