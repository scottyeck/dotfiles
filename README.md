## TODO

* [ ] Rename this thing to dotfiles.
* [ ] Add various configs that are currently missing
  * [ ] Alacritty
  * [ ] Karabiner elements
  * [ ] coc - config / extensions
* [ ] Add pre-commit hook that alphabetizes spells
  * _Alternatively_, just put the spells in Dropbox because this is annoying.
* [ ] Add `brew-leaves` to init.
* [ ] Add notes about [shpotify](https://github.com/hnarayanan/shpotify) _somewhere_.
* [ ] Complete CLI tool docs.
